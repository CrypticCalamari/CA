# Project: CA
----------------------
## Synopsis
CA is going to be an extensible / modular Cellular Automata editing and visualization framework.
## Motivation
Are there other Cellular Automata programs out there? Sure, but are they written by me? No. Essentially my motivation is to use some concept with broad branches that interests me in order to learn and practice programming.

I plan to re-implement this framework / program in other languages as the need to learn those languages arises.
